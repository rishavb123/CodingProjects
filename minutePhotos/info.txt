This is a python program that takes pictures using the webcam on my computer and then pushes them onto my website constantly. This allows me to be away somewhere and see what is happening infront of my laptop from online while the program is running. This will not run if it is not on my computer though since it needs to be in the correct file location and have git installed with the correct authorization to upload to my website.

The image is uploaded to rishavb123.github.io/minutePhotos/contents (it isn't live updating since the program isn't running)
