This is a python program that I have created that takes in data and stores it into text files about how many people have gotten a disease during certain years. Then using this data, it finds a trend, gives you the option to graph the data to see it for yourself, and also it can make predictions about how many people will have the disease based on the numbers given. The program is not always accurate so it also displays how accurate the information is according to the data and if the disease follows the trend it has been going at. This program can also compare two seperate diseases to see which one is worse and to provide additional information. The File to run to run this program is Template.py.
